# Web-App-Project-TIW-2022-Maestri-Longo-main
The purpose of the project is to create a drive service in two different version: pure HTML and RIA (javascript).
The user can create an account, so it can login/logout from it. Once it made a login, it can manage its folders and files: create, edit, delete, ecc.
The RIA version includes a trash folder and drag & drop option for moving file/folder.

The project is made by me and my associate Virgina Longo.
This is the final exam of the course "Tecnologie informatiche per il web 2022" at Politecnico of Milano.
